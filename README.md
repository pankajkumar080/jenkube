## Let‚Äôs Come to our Project/Task, So what I have build today‚ùì Excited‚Ä¶
1. Create container image that‚Äôs has Jenkins installed using Dockerfile Or You can use the Jenkins Server on RHEL 8/7, When we launch this image, it should automatically start the Jenkins service in the container.
2. Create a job chain of job1, job2, job3 and job4 using build pipeline plugin in Jenkins
3. Job1: Pull the Github repo automatically when some developers push repo to Github.
4. Job2 :
‚Üí By looking at the code or program file, Jenkins should automatically start the respective language interpreter installed image container to deploy code on top of Kubernetes ( eg. If code is of HTML, then Jenkins should start the container that has HTML already installed )
‚Üí Expose your pod so that testing team could perform the testing on the pod
‚Üí Make the data to remain persistent ( If server collects some data like logs, other user information )
5. Job3: Test your app if it is working or not.
6. Job4 : If an app is not working, then send email to the developer with error messages and redeploy the application after code is being edited by the developer
